    <h1>AQUEEL UR RAHMAN KHAN</h1>
    <p><em>Class representative at UG council 2021-2022 </em></p>
  </center>

  <p>I’m currently an undergraduate of The Oxford college of Science which is affiliated with Bangalore University
     with a degree in Computer Science and Applications. During my time in college, I held several leadership positions,
      including the class representative of undergraduate council & proactive member at the Oxford research club associates.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m a skilled public speaker and have experience with workshops, event planning, hosting technical & cultural
    events and fest organizing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Computer Science has been driven by a passion for working on projects that have an impact on how people use
    technology in their daily lives. Being a very curious person, I am always keen on updating my knowledge base
    to the latest tech stack. Enthusiastic team player, a fast learner with creative problem-solving skills, good
     coding and communication skills.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m eager to use my skills in a larger organization where I can have a greater impact. I’m seeking an entry-level
     position in an esteemed organization. Interested in getting exposure to domains providing intellectually
     challenging work in the field of computers for proving and enriching my knowledge and skills</p>
